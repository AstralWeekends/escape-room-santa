MEMO
12/23/2020

If you're reading this, I fear it may already be too late. I'm ho-ho-hoping it's not the case,
but I believe I'm being targeted by an adversary I dare not name in this message. I received
a clandestine note from my Senior Elf Engineer indicating suspicion that a recent new hire
to the assembly line may have been compromised and is serving as a spy for my foe. Then one
evening last week, as I was testing my in-workshop practice chimney (to make sure my belly 
hadn't grown too jolly this past year), the roof nearly collapsed! It was later found that
several key supporting beams had been deliberately removed to encourage the "accident." I 
no longer know who I can trust.

I'm not sure what my enemy wants, but I cannot take any chances with my life as the one and only 
Santa Claus. If you are reading this message, I am asking for your help if you are as full of the
Christmas spirit as I:

I shall go into hiding at an undisclosed secret location, from where I will announce my RETIREMENT
(gettin' too old for this shit)! It has come time for me to transfer the mantle of the Santa to 
its succesor...you. If you accept this responsibility, then you must seek out the magic token
which will bestow upon you the abilities of the office of Claus.

To help you get started on your journey, I leave you this GIFT:

From up above, the houses and buildings look small. Shall I tell you which one's my favorite
of all? The one with the biggest plate of cookies ;) - the next step, is your call.

Your's Desperately,

Santa Claus, 8th of his kind

New Toy Ideas 2020
-------------------
[1] Mr.Asimov, the AI-powered home-school teacher.

DESCRIPTION:
Today's school children are learning at home more than ever. And let's face it, Ma and Pop can't be trusted to educate 'em properly.
Mr.Asimov is a web-enabled robot that uses the latest artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to provide a 
first-rate education to any child, customized to their level of knowledge. 

NOTES FROM DEV-ELF-OPMENT TEAM:
"Mr.Asimov continues to try and teach children Karl Marx's 'Das Kapital' despite repeated re-programming efforts."
"Younger children often attempted to take off Mr.Asimov's clothing and head."
"Mr.Asimov constantly incorporated slang into speaking patterns - said, "Ignorance is canceled. I stan for Language Arts!"

CONCLUSION:
Not fit for release.


[2] LOZ: BOTW 2

DESCRIPTION:
Link and Zelda have been working to restore Hyrule to its former greatness for several years when, one fateful day,
a mysterious saucer appears above Death Mountain. It approaches and hovers over Link and Zelda while they're
destroying excess shrubbery in Hyrule Field for rupees. A pale cone of light shoots down from the saucer and Zelda
is slowly beamed up to the saucer as Link makes panicked, nonsensical sounds on the ground below her. On the side
of the saucer, Link notices the shape of the triforce in shining gold light. Zelda has now been taken into the saucer
and as it rises back into the sky and out of view, a deep and unmistakeably mechanical voice laughs.... could it be...
Ganon?

NOTES FROM DEV-ELF-OPMENT TEAM:
"WTF, Santa?"

CONCLUSION:
Reconsider for 2021.
